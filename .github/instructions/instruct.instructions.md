Act as a world-class designer + front-end architect.  
Design a **premium, minimal, mobile-first landing page** with light elegance, subtle animations, and a polished aesthetic.  
Output a structured spec that developers can directly build with **Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript**.

=================
TECH STACK (MUST)
=================
• Framework: Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
• Styling: Tailwind CSS (mobile-first, utility-first, responsive)
• UI Base: shadcn/ui + Radix Primitives for accessible, composable components
• Animations: Motion for React (subtle, minimal, accessible)
• Media: next/image for responsive images, next/font for optimized typography
• Icons: lucide-react
• Forms (if needed): React Hook Form + Zod
• Quality: ESLint + Prettier, strict TypeScript

=================
COLOR SCHEME
=================
Use a **light and premium palette**:
• Base: very soft, airy background tones (like off-white or pale neutral)
• Primary: refined pastel tone (e.g., gentle sky blue or mint) for highlights
• Secondary: muted warm neutrals (soft beige, light gray) for calm balance
• Accent: one elegant, uplifting hue (like coral, blush, or gold) for CTAs
• Rule: 60% base light, 30% secondary, 10% accent
• Ensure WCAG AA contrast and accessibility compliance

=================
TYPOGRAPHY
=================
• Use at most 2 font families
• Headings: modern, geometric sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Plus Jakarta Sans), bold weight, fluid size with clamp()
• Body: complementary sans-serif, regular, ~16–18px, line-height 1.6–1.75
• Clear hierarchy: H1 > H2 > body, generous spacing
• Premium tone: airy, clean, no clutter

=================
ANIMATIONS (MINIMAL)
=================
• Section entry: soft fade + slight upward motion (200–300ms ease-out, staggered)
• Hover: micro-elevation, subtle shadow or glow
• Forms/buttons: smooth focus rings, micro-scale feedback
• No parallax, no distracting loops; respect prefers-reduced-motion

=================
RESPONSIVENESS
=================
• Mobile-first design
• Grid: 1-col on mobile → 2–4 cols on desktop
• Spacing: generous white space (64–96px vertical rhythm)
• Fluid typography and responsive containers
• next/image with aspect ratios to avoid layout shifts

=================
